// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

import 'package:munjiz/main.dart'; // Keep this import for MunjizApp

void main() {
  testWidgets('App smoke test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Build our app and trigger a frame.
    await tester.pumpWidget(const MunjizApp());

    // Verify that the app starts with the splash screen or login page
    expect(find.byType(MaterialApp), findsOneWidget);
    // You might want to add more specific checks here, e.g., for a specific text or widget on the initial screen
    // For now, just check if the MaterialApp is present
  });
